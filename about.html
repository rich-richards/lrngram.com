      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Learngram was created by <strong>Mekulu Awolo Thierry Edouard</strong> in 2024.
        It is a platform designed for children and people who have no basic knowledge
        of the English language.
      </p>
      <p>
        English is the foundation language on Learngram. Through interactive lessons,
        games, and a joyful approach, Learngram provides all the fun and engagement
        children and beginners need to learn efficiently.
